The world is filled with endless possibilities - and I believe that creativity is the key to unlocking its hidden potential. Iâ€™ve always been someone who spends her time dreaming up new worlds and pondering solutions to challenges, just to experience the satisfaction that comes with developing a new idea. Art has long been my medium of choice for exploring what my imagination holds. From staying agile while navigating the fast-paced tech startup world, to rapidly conceptualizing new motion design concepts for an internationally-recognized baby gear brand - Iâ€™ve learned that it takes more than just a propensity towards artistic expression to build a tried-and-true problem-solver.

When I first took the leap into software development, I was surprised to find that trading in storyboards for process diagrams could feel like a parallel shift rather than a linear one. In fact, making use of the ingenuity, patience, and team camaraderie my previous roles have forged within me makes the journey as enjoyable as it is exciting. Iâ€™m delighted to have new tools at my disposal to engineer clean, efficient solutions to a new array of challenges. But most of all, Iâ€™m honored to be on a team of inquisitive, creatively-minded developers just like me.
